                    the dense forests of the Sayan Mountains and the harsh ice of the Putorana plateau. And also to see all these beauties 
                    it is possible without millions in the account, a passport and many hours of flights. Like, for example,

                                First of all, because of the mountains: if you drive along the ridge,
                                you will see slopes strewn with pine trees, mountain rivers and lakes.
                                And if you open the windows in the car, you can get acquainted
                                with the invisible miracle of these places — mountain air.</p>
                            <p class="place__paragraph">The climate in Altai is temperate, so it's best to go here in summer.
                                So you will see all the diversity of the local flora and fauna. Through the woods
                                Moose roam the Altai, eagles fly over the ridges, and graze on the plains
                                roe deer. And the famous manuls are also inhabitants of the Altai Territory.</p>

                            <p class="place__paragraph">Of course, this is all true. Baikal is also an ideal place for
                                skioring competitions. This is a kind of sport when a skier ties himself
                                to the motorcycle, and the tandem tries to develop as much speed as possible on the ice.
                                In March 2019, a world record of 197.011 km/h was set at the Baikal Mile Festival.</p>
